So the event was called “God Cares,” and it was basically a school-wide mass that everyone from different colleges had to attend. It was held at the campus chapel, and yeah, it was one of those big gatherings where almost the whole school was there. The goal was probably to remind us that God’s always there for us, especially with all the stress from classes and stuff. I was supposed to attend the whole thing, but I only caught part of it since I had other stuff going on. My role was just being part of the audience listening, standing, sitting, singing a bit, the usual mass routine. The priests and campus ministers led everything, and the student volunteers handled the readings and songs.                    </p>

                <div id="sowhat" class="tab-content">
                    <p>
I can’t say I learned a whole new skill or anything, but I did get a short reminder that sometimes, we all just need to slow down and listen. My expectation was just “another mass we have to attend,” and honestly, it was kind of that but still, the short part I caught was meaningful. What surprised me a bit was seeing how into it some people were; like, you could actually feel that some students really connected with the message. I think what impacted me was the message about God’s care and not being too hard on yourself, which kinda hit because, well, school’s been a lot. The most difficult part was just staying focused the whole time (mass can be long, man), but the best part was the calm atmosphere. It gave me a bit of peace before diving back into chaos.                    </p>

                <div id="nowwhat" class="tab-content">
                    <p>
Even though I didn’t attend the entire thing, it still made me realize that taking a pause once in a while is important. Sometimes, just being in that space reminds you that you’re not doing everything alone. I think I could apply that by not stressing too much and trying to trust that things will work out, one way or another. I’ll probably join the next one — or at least show up on time next time. I do see the benefit of having masses like this; it reminds everyone that we’re part of something bigger, not just classes and deadlines. If I could do it again, I’d probably stay for the whole thing (and maybe pay better attention).

Because of this activity, I am <strong>a little more reminded that God’s got my back even when I feel like I’m barely keeping up.</strong>
