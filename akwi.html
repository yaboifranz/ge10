The CCS Acquaintance Party was held on August 4, 2025, at 7:00 PM. It was my first time performing on stage in front of the whole CCS department. The event was a get-together for everyone, with food, music, and performances. I played the guitar and sang the song “Tensionado,” which was a bit nerve-wracking at first since it was my first stage performance.                    </p>

Honestly, the program itself was a bit boring at times, but the food totally made up for it. The highlight for me was getting the chance to perform and just spend time with my friends. I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much, but once I started playing, the tension went away. It was fun seeing everyone cheer and vibe along. The hardest part was controlling my nerves before going up, but after that, it felt great. It made me realize how fun it is to try new things even if you feel shy at first.                    </p>

From this event, I learned that performing in front of people isn’t as scary as I thought. It gave me more confidence to take part in other events and not overthink it. I can apply that by saying yes more often when opportunities like that come up. The benefit of this event is that it helps students socialize and express themselves. If I could do it again, I’d pick a different song and maybe even perform with a group next time.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more confident in performing and trying out new experiences.</strong>
