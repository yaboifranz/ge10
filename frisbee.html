The Frisbee Pasiklaban happened on October 23, 2025, at 11:30 AM. I didn’t really know much about it before attending, but it turned out to be part of the SHS Sportsfest. It was basically a frisbee game where different senior high teams competed. I was just a spectator, watching the matches with some of my friends.                    </p>

                <div id="sowhat" class="tab-content">
                    <p>
Even though I wasn’t playing, it was still fun to watch. The players were really competitive and energetic, and it made me realize frisbee is actually more intense than it looks. I didn’t expect to enjoy it that much since I thought it would be slow, but the games were fast and entertaining. The best part was cheering for random teams and laughing with my friends. The only hard part was sitting under the sun for too long, but the overall vibe was good. It showed me that sports events can still be fun even if you’re just watching.                    </p>

Watching Frisbee Pasiklaban reminded me how nice it is to just enjoy school events without stressing over academics. It also made me want to try playing frisbee someday, just for fun. I think I can apply that by being more active in sports or joining similar activities instead of just watching. The benefit of this event is that it builds school spirit and lets people enjoy friendly competition. If I could do it again, I’d probably bring snacks and find a better spot under the shade.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more open to joining or watching sports events in school.</strong>
