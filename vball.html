The Volleyball Dual Meet was held on August 20, 2025, at 9:00 AM. It was one of the school’s official sports events, featuring different teams competing against each other. I attended as part of the audience with my friends. I didn’t really know much about what was happening, but it was entertaining to watch.                    </p>

Even though I wasn’t playing, it was nice seeing everyone’s energy and teamwork on the court. The players were giving their best and the crowd was cheering them on. I didn’t expect to get into it, but it was actually fun watching. The only hard part was following the score since I didn’t catch all the rules, but it was fine. It was just a good experience seeing how much effort goes into every match.                    </p>

This event made me appreciate how much dedication athletes put into their sport. I learned that even as a spectator, you can still feel the excitement and team spirit. I could apply that by being more supportive of school activities in general. The benefit of events like this is that they encourage teamwork and healthy competition. If I could do it again, I’d probably stay longer and watch more matches.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more supportive of sports events and the effort athletes put into them.</strong>
