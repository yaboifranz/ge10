This event was the Billiards Tournament held on October 22, 2025, at 4:00 PM. I was both the organizer and one of the players in the 1v1 category. The event was part of our department activities, and a lot of my classmates and friends joined. My job as organizer was to help set up the tables, make sure the matches were scheduled properly, and just keep everything running smoothly. After that, I also got to play, which made it even more fun.                    </p>

I actually had a great time with this one. I didn’t just enjoy organizing, but I also had fun competing with my friends. I ended up winning the 1v1 category, which made the whole thing even better. At first, I thought it would be stressful to organize and play at the same time, but it wasn’t that bad. The only hard part was keeping track of who was next in line to play, but the rest went fine. I liked how everyone was just there to have fun and chill. It reminded me that even simple activities like this can bring people together and help you bond more with classmates.                    </p>

From this event, I learned that organizing something while also being part of it takes a bit of balance, but it’s doable if you plan it right. It gave me some confidence in handling events, even small ones. I could apply that by helping out with future activities or tournaments. I’ll probably keep joining next time since it was a good mix of fun and teamwork. The benefit of this kind of event is that it brings everyone together in a friendly competition. If I could do it again, I’d maybe add a doubles category to make it more exciting.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more confident in managing and joining activities at the same time.</strong>
