This event was the Orientation and Team Building of the SUSG Research Committee, held on August 13, 2025, at 9:00 AM. It was mostly about getting to know each other and planning what we’d do for the school year. I was part of the logistics and technical team, so I helped with setup and fixing any tech issues that popped up. Everyone in the org was there including the officers, new members, and a few facilitators. We played games, talked about our goals, and just had fun hanging out.                    </p>

I actually learned a bit about teamwork and how much behind-the-scenes work goes into making events run smoothly. At first, I expected it to be just long talks and introductions, but it turned out to be more interactive and fun. The games really helped break the ice and it made me realize that the org wasn’t as intimidating as I thought. The only part I didn’t enjoy was setting up some of the stuff since technical issues can get annoying, but seeing everything run well after was satisfying. I liked how everyone was friendly and easy to work with. It kind of showed me that even small roles matter when everyone’s doing their part.                    </p>

The experience reminded me that teamwork really makes everything easier. I learned that being reliable and chill under pressure is pretty useful, especially in event setups. I’ll apply that next time by being more prepared for technical stuff and helping out where I can. I plan to keep being active in the org because it’s a good way to meet people and get experience outside of academics. I see the benefits since we build connections, learn how to organize events, and actually enjoy what we do. If I could do it again, I’d probably bring extra cables and snacks because both always run out.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more confident working with a team and handling stuff behind the scenes.</strong>
