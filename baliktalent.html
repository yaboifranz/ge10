So this event was part of CCS Week which was on August 28 2025 at 2:00PM, called “Batch 2005 Balik Talent Lectures: Path Beyond the Code.” It was held in our department, and literally everyone was there, from first years to fourth years, plus the faculty, staff, and some alumni who graduated from the College of Computer Studies. The main idea was for the alumni from batch 2005 to share what they’re doing now and give us some kind of “life after college” talk. My role was kind of random, I had to perform for classroom points, so I sang “December” by Neck Deep. Not my best concert, but it got the job done. The rest of the time I just listened to the talks and watched the performances.                    </p>

Honestly, I thought it was gonna be all serious tech stuff, like coding stories or programming wisdom or something. But what cracked me up was that most of the alumni ended up in totally different fields, like real estate or business. Not exactly “Path Beyond the Code,” more like “Far Away From the Code.” Still, it was actually interesting hearing how they used what they learned from CCS in their other careers. I didn’t exactly learn a new skill, but I did get a new perspective, that life doesn’t always go where you expect it to. The surprising part was how chill and funny the alumni were, like they weren’t trying to act all successful and perfect. I liked that. The hardest part? Performing, I guess. Singing in front of everyone for points isn’t my ideal Friday. The best part though was just hanging out with my classmates and watching everyone do their thing.                    </p>

After hearing those stories, I realized that a degree doesn’t lock you into one path. You can go anywhere with it, even if it’s not related to what you studied. That kinda took the pressure off thinking I have to end up in some strict IT job right after graduation. I can apply that by just keeping an open mind about where I’ll end up. If there’s another CCS week, I’ll still join, but maybe I’ll pick a different talent next time, something less nerve-racking. I definitely see the benefit of this kind of event, it gives you a peek into real life after school, and it’s good to know the alumni are doing fine even if they’re not all in tech. If I could redo it, I’d probably stay more engaged during the Q&A and not just zone out halfway through.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>a bit more chill about the future and less stressed about sticking to just one career path.</strong>                    </p>
