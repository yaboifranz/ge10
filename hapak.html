Hapak was an event held on September 24, 2025, at 2:15 PM. I didn’t really know what it was about at first, but my friend told me it was organized by the MedTech department and it turned out to be a pickleball tournament. It was one of those inter-department sports activities. I attended as an audience member, just watching the games.                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="sowhat" class="tab-content">
                    <p>
It was actually kind of interesting seeing a sport I wasn’t familiar with. Pickleball looked like a mix of tennis and ping pong, and everyone seemed really into it. I didn’t expect to enjoy it, but it was cool to see something new. I liked watching how competitive the players were and how supportive their friends were from the sidelines. The hardest part was just trying to understand the rules, but after a while it made sense. I enjoyed just being there and watching something different.                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="nowwhat" class="tab-content">
                    <p>
From this event, I learned that there are more kinds of sports than I thought, and trying to understand them can actually be fun. I could apply that by being more open to learning new things and not judging an activity before knowing what it is. The benefit of this event is that it encourages students to try new sports and stay active. If I could do it again, I’d probably join instead of just watching.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more curious about trying out new and unfamiliar sports.</strong>
