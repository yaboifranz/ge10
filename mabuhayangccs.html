The Parada Sillimaniana took place on August 27, 2025, at 6:30 PM during the Hibalag season. It was a school festival filled with parades, performances, and celebrations. I joined as part of our group’s presentation, working as one of the propsmen. After the parade, we performed at the Cimafranca Ballfield, which was one of the main highlights of the night.                    </p>

This event was honestly one of the most fun things I joined that semester. Even though I was just a propsman, I still felt part of something big. The atmosphere was lively and everyone was in a good mood. Seeing the crowd and all the different performances made it a really cool experience. It wasn’t hard work, but it did take a lot of coordination to make sure everything went smoothly. I really enjoyed being part of the team and helping out behind the scenes.                    </p>

From this event, I learned that even small roles matter when you’re part of a big group performance. It made me appreciate teamwork and the effort people put in to make an event successful. I can apply that by continuing to help and participate in school activities, even in small ways. The benefit of this kind of event is that it strengthens school pride and builds friendships. If I could do it again, I’d definitely join next year too and maybe even try performing on stage.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more appreciative of teamwork and school spirit.</strong>
