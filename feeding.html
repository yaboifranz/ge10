The Buñao Daycare Feeding Program happened on September 24, 2025, at 4:00 PM. It was a community outreach activity where we got to feed and play with nursery kids. I was one of the hosts for the program and also helped with logistics, like guiding my team around and setting up. We served champorado and milk for the kids and spent time playing with them and making them laugh.                    </p>

Honestly, this was one of the best experiences I’ve had so far. It was just pure good vibes. Hosting was super fun, and the kids were so cute and energetic that you couldn’t help but smile the whole time. I felt like my inner child came back for a while. It surprised me how much happiness something that simple could bring. The hardest part was keeping the kids entertained since they had so much energy, but it was worth it. What I liked most was seeing them happy and being part of something meaningful.                    </p>

This event reminded me how important it is to give back to the community, especially to kids who don’t have much. It made me realize that helping others doesn’t always have to be big — sometimes, small moments like this mean a lot. I can apply this by joining more outreach programs and continuing to volunteer whenever I can. If I could do it again, I definitely would, no question. It just felt good to be part of something that spreads joy.

Because of this activity, I am <strong>more grateful, kinder, and more connected to my inner child.</strong>
